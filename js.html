          <b>About:</b> So far you have learned how to add text and pictures to a website. Now you will learn how to add shapes. Click on the link above and copy the code given in the reference sheets into the HTML, CSS and Javascript files.This will add a canvas to the website and draw shapes on it. Later, we will learn how to color and animate these shapes. If you did the shapes in Thimble you can skip this lesson.<br>
          <b>Objective:</b> Learn the code used in creating a canvas and shapes.<br>
          <b>Essential Question:</b> How do programmers draw on websites?<br>
          <b>Vocabulary:</b> Variable, Canvas, Z-Index, Arc, Bezier Curve<br>
          <b>Standards:</b> SC.68.CS-CP.3.2	Create online content (e.g., webpage, blog, digital portfolio, multimedia), using advanced design tools.<br>

          <b>About:</b> You learned the key words and symbols used in creating a canvas and shapes. To complete this task you must understand what every line of code does and what the parameters (the numbers in the parentheses) do. Click on the above link and go through the code in HTML and Javascript and correct any mistakes you find. The website is supposed to draw a house on the canvas. Utilize the reference sheets from the script kiddie challenge.<br>
          <b>Objective:</b> Analyze the code used in creating a canvas and shapes and demonstrate understanding of how it works.<br>
          <b>Essential Question:</b> How does the code I learned last lesson work?<br>
          <b>Vocabulary:</b> Parameter, Variable, Canvas, Z-Index, Arc, Bezier Curve<br>
