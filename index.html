          I am not here for a paycheck, and you are not here for a grade. We are here to develop the ability to communicate with computers. This is no easy task. You have to learn how to think like a computer. You have a lot of vocabulary and rules to learn. You must become extremely detail orientated. And you must learn to overcome the frustration of failure that is a part of developing any significant program. Becoming a computer programmer is a long journey, but one worth taking. With our abilities we can create games and art, we can solve problems, and we can hack the technological world around us.<br><br> In this class we will be learning how to create websites on <a href = "https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/" target = "_blank">Thimble</a> with the HTML and CSS languages. Then we will switch to <a href="https://glitch.com/" target = "_blank">Glitch</a> to learn how to use Javascript to add games and animations to websites. And finally we will learn how to use C# to code 3d games and animations in the Unity game engine. But first we start with the basics of computer hardware and learning what a program is with <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/" target = "_blank">Scratch</a>. I will be grading you on your progress instead of the final result. If you are wisely investing time in this class I will see it in you code, even if it is not working correctly. I know all you are capable of learning to code.<br><br> - Mr. Manning<br><br>

        <p>
          Last week you created fake news websites. Here are some excellent examples:<a href ="https://thimbleprojects.org/thatsmyopinionn/415508/index.html" target = "_blank">Engell</a> <a href ="https://thimbleprojects.org/ertyuu/412011/index.html" target = "_blank">Franco</a> <a href = "https://thimbleprojects.org/ib0711/412559/index.html" target = "_blank">Isabella</a> <a href = "https://thimbleprojects.org/asap52/407746/" target = "_blank">Rachel</a> <a href = "https://thimbleprojects.org/mackenzie-rayne/411844/" target = "_blank">Aiyanna&Trista</a>. If we can create fake news websites in here, can other random people? YES! Here is a true story on fake news. One of my conservative in-laws was trying to convince everyone at a party I was attending that Hillary Clinton murdered a pilot, because he flew Bill Clinton around and "knew too much." Out of boredom and curiosity I tracked the story to a news site that was later identified as a fake news website, created by a liberal who was playing a practical joke on conservatives. Fake sites like this compelled people like my crazy in-law to spread these fake stories, and spurred many people who don't usually vote to go out and vote for President Trump. The moral of the story is not "don't trust the internet" or that "all news is fake news", but that you need to learn how to research and think critically about information you are presented with. 
          <br><br>
          This week you are creating an account with <a href = "https://github.com/" target = "_blank">github</a> and then using it to log into <a href = "https://glitch.com" target = "_blank">glitch</a>. Glitch is similar to thimble but is faster at processing javascript and can hold more data. It is also a professional tool rather than a training environment. You will have to click on "show live" when you start a new project and arrange the tabs on the screen to see your website as you develop it. Your projects are automatically published as you work on them. Do not violate copyright infringments and do not place anything on your website that is innapropriate or the moderaters at Glitch will delete your account.<br><br>When you have logged into Glitch click on the Javascript link in the menu. This week you are completing the canvas and shapes section.
