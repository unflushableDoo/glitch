        <p>
          This week you are creating an account with <a href = "https://github.com/" target = "_blank">github</a> and then using it to log into <a href = "https://glitch.com" target = "_blank">glitch</a>. Glitch is similar to thimble but is faster at processing javascript and can hold more data. It is also a professional tool rather than a training environment. You will have to click on "show live" when you start a new project and arrange the tabs on the screen to see your website as you develop it. Your projects are automatically published as you work on them. Do not violate copyright infringments and do not place anything on your website that is innapropriate or the moderaters at Glitch will delete your account.<br><br>When you have logged into Glitch click on the Javascript link in the left bar. This week you are completing the canvas and shapes section.
