          I am not here for a paycheck, and you are not here for a grade. We are here to develop the ability to communicate with computers. This is no easy task. You have to learn how to think like a computer. You have a lot of vocabulary and rules to learn. You must become extremely detail orientated. And you must learn to overcome the frustration of failure that is a part of developing any significant program. Becoming a computer programmer is a long journey, but one worth taking. With our abilities we can create games and art, we can solve problems, and we can hack the technological world around us.<br><br> - Mr. Manning<br><br>

          I have added a pixel grid to the JS Unit 1 project. If you already started that project and would like to use the grid, copy the js code in <a href = "https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mrmangrid" target = "_blank">this</a> project to your project above the ***programmer challenge*** section. Every blue line is 100 pixels, every red line is 10 pixels.
